# wordcloud_dei_project

This project is about an exploratory data analysis for the voluntary DEI (diversity, equality & inclusion) team at my employer.

The goal was to assess and understand the perception of diversity & inclusion and status quo in the company. One part of this audit was to understand how diverse and inclusive our products are. For this, I reviewed the characters of our flagship games and their descriptions to understand:

* The overall representation of genders* within our games
* Whether specific words are used to describe the characters by gender

** *It is important to state that diversity and inclusion goes beyond gender. However, given the nature of the characters in the game, gender seemed like a feasible and good first feature to analyse
